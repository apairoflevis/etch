# etch
Simple etch-a-sketch program


Created an etch-a-sketch using html,css, and js. Used flexbox for the container and inside squares.

Used JS to create the additional grids and squares based on user input (1-100 grid size).

All in all, an interesting project in learning how to use JS to create CSS classes and using loops to iterate the grid size based on user input.
